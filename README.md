# ddev + Gitpod
## Set up a full Drupal dev environment in a browser (now using Drupal 10!)

This project demonstrates a <strong>complete Drupal 10</strong> (10.0.3) development environment, utilizing ddev and Gitpod, through your browser.  

## This is a branch from @shaal - creates a blank Drupal site instead of a Unami Demo ##

## Prerequisites:
1. [Sign up for gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/login)

## Try it out:
1. Click on the following link
  <a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/imrodmartin/ddev-gitpod" target="_blank">https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/imrodmartin/ddev-gitpod</a>
1. Your environment is being prepared, wait about 40 seconds (A splash screen will appear)
2. VScode IDE will be displayed, a few seconds later you will see a fresh blank Drupal site.
3. Open your website's URL in a browser (at the bottom of the terminal window)
4. :tada:

## Do you like PhpStorm instead of Theia or VScode?
1. Open a bash window at the bottom
2. `.ddev/run-phpstorm.sh`

## How does it work?
1. Gitpod - development environment based on Docker
    1. [.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.yml)
        1. Defines the main docker image this environment is built on - `.gitpod.Dockerfile`
        1. Run prebuild commands:
            1. Start ddev
            1. Run `composer install`
            1. Installs blank Drupal website
    1. [.gitpod.Dockerfile](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.Dockerfile)
        1. Set base image to Gitpod's `workspace-full` ([link](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/tree/master/full))
        1. Install ddev using brew
1. ddev - ridiculously simple setup for complex development environments, allows developers working locally or working with Gitpod in the cloud.
    1. [.ddev/config.yaml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.ddev/config.yaml) - main ddev (default) configuration, can be generated by running `ddev config`

## Thank you

### Persistent Storage:
* Gitpod backs up the state of the `/workspace/` folder between workspace starts, so that you can revisit them later. Attention: Files in other locations will not be saved!
