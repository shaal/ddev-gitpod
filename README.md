## Prerequisites:
1. [Sign up for gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io/login)

## Try it out:
1. Click on the following link
  https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod
1. Your environment is being prepared, wait about 40 seconds (A splash screen will appear)
1. VScode (or Theia) IDE will be displayed.
1. Note that one terminal is running `sudo docker-up`, and another terminal in parallel is running `ddev start`
1. Find your website's URL `gp url 8080`
1. Open your website's URL in a browser, you should see Drupal's installation screen.
1. Run in terminal `ddev drush si demo_umami -y`
1. Open your website's URL in a browser, you should see Drupal's Umami demo.
1. Run in terminal `ddev xdebug on`
1. Open VScode's debugger, place a new breakpoint in `web/index.php`
1. Open your website's URL in a browser.
1. :tada:

## Do you like PhpStorm instead of Theia or VScode?
1. Open a bash window at the bottom
2. `.ddev/run-phpstorm.sh`
3. When it shows you port 9999 is up, click the link and use PhpStorm with this repo.

## How does it work?
1. Gitpod - development environment based on Docker
    1. [.gitpod.yml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.yml)
        1. Defines the main docker image this environment is built on - `.gitpod.Dockerfile`
        1. Run initial commands using 3 terminals in parallel:
            1. `gitpod-setup-ddev.sh`
            1. `composer install`
            1. `sudo docker-up`
    1. [.gitpod.Dockerfile](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.gitpod.Dockerfile)
        1. Set base image to Gitpod's `workspace-full` ([link](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images/tree/master/full))
        1. Install ddev using brew
1. ddev - ridiculously simple setup for complex development environments
    1. [.ddev/config.yaml](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.ddev/config.yaml) - main ddev (default) configuration, can be generated by running `ddev config`
    1. [.ddev/gitpod-setup-ddev.sh](https://github.com/shaal/ddev-gitpod/blob/main/.ddev/gitpod-setup-ddev.sh) - generate config overrides for ddev to work in the Gitpod environment.
        1. Delete any existing Docker images and containers (due to Gitpod bug, that cause issues when restarting a workspace)
        1. Set certain ports to public, following Gitpod's syntax `[port]-[workspace-url]`
            1. `8080` - Drupal Website
            1. `8025` - Mailhog
            1. `8036` - PHPmyadmin
        1. Set `host.docker.internal` with the correct value of gitpod's host ip
        1. Starts ddev

### Persistent Storage:
* Gitpod backs up the state of the `/workspace/` folder between workspace starts, so that you can revisit them later. Attention: Files in other locations will not be saved!
